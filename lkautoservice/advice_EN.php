    <p class="advh">How to change oil</p>
<article class="row">
    <ol class="col-lg-9">
        <li>Park your car somewhere on level ground. Put the car in 1st gear or in Park if you’re driving an automatic.</li>
        <li>Put an object, like a bit of wood or specialized wheel stops behind your rear tyres. This is done to avoid the car moving backwards.</li>
        <li>You need to find your car’s jacking points. These are safe places where jacks can be placed in order to lift up the car.</li>
        <li>Jack up the front part of the car, so that both the front tyres are off the ground</li>
        <li>Open up your oil cap</li>
        <li>Look for your oil pan under the car. It’s usually located right below the oil cap, and is easily distinguishable by a single nut on the sides of it.</li>
        <li>After you’ve located the oil pan, place a container of some sort below it, you don’t want contaminated oil spilling on the ground</li>
        <li>Unscrew the nut on the oil pan, wait until all of the oil has drained out.</li>
        <li>Don’t forget to screw the nut back on.</li>
        <li>Put in the new oil. As the engine parts are already coated with a previous layer of oil, you can use a leaner oil consistency, in order to not strain the engine with more lubricant than is required.</li>

    <p class="advh">How to change sparkplugs</p>
<article class="row">
    <ol class="col-lg-9">
        <li>Firstly you need to locate them. The easiest way to do that is to find your car’s manual, which has detailed description of the position of components. The general rule of thumb, however is that on any inline engine (All of the cylinders are in one horizontal line) the spark plugs are either on the top or side of the engine, positioned in a single row, and on V-shaped engines (There is more than 1 row of cylinders, in a V-shape) they should be evenly separated on each part of the engine.</li>
        <li>WARNING: Let the car cool off before you touch anything on the engine</li>
        <li>Pull the wire plug out by hand. DO NOT pull hard or pull by the wire, clutch the plug itself and pull it out, it should not require a lot of force to pull out.</li>
        <li>Use your socket wrench to take the spark plug out, make sure the wrench is at the very bottom of the opening and turn clock-wise. The spark plug should come out.</li>
        <li>Use this opportunity to clean around the wire connections with compressed air, in order to insure a snug fit.</li>
        <li>Place your replacement plugs into the socket wrench and put the new plug in.</li>
